  "content": "Yes.  You must consume the request before writing the response.  Once you start writing your response, you can't read more of the request any more.\n\nThe App Engine behavior is intentional, in order to match the behavior of Go's stand-alone HTTP server.\n\nThere were deadlocks before this behavior was implemented:   a client sending a large request body would block until their request was sent, not reading the response from the server.  But if the server was blocked writing the response, it wouldn't consume more of the request.\n\nI figure we could relax the behavior in the future if anybody can definitively tell me what is correct.  RFC 2616 doesn't seem to say either way, or I can't find it.",
